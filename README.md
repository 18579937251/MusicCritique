## Introduction

This is merely a temporary repository that I use to store my data or codes while developing my graduation project, therefore its structure is ugly and to be honest, it is just a mess. Some of its codes may will be reorganized and moved to another repositories later, but while this messy place still exists, I hope those who are interested in my projects could benefit from what I have learnt. Thanks a lot.
 
## Structure

- _/attempts_ folder contains some simple composition practice, just for fun.

- _/misc_ contains some other codes that I use to learn or practice some basic usage
- _/models_ contains some codes that I used for reference, not my own codes.
- _/musegan_ contains generator/discriminator that I borrowed from MuseGAN project, I am trying to transform it into pyTorch.
